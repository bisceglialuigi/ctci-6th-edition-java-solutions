# Cracking the Code interview 6th Edition Java Solutions
In this repo I track my solutions implemented in Java programming language to exercices proposed in the book Cracking The Coding Interview 6th Edition by Gayle Laakmaan Mcdowell.

The folders hierarchy is as follow:
- Chapter_{chapterNumber}_{chapterName}
    - E{exerciseNumber}_{exerciseName}

Feel free to submit a PR if you spot something wrong (I would be so thankful!) or you have any proposal.

Have fun!
