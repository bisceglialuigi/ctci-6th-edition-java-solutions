# Cracking the Code interview 6th Edition Java Solutions
In this repo I track my solutions implemented in Java programming language to exercices proposed in the book Cracking The Coding Interview 6th Edition by Gayle Laakmaan Mcdowell.

For each Chapater I create a package specifing Chapter number and what is about. For each exercise I create a class. In the main I call the method solution. For each problem I could propose different solutions, the first it's the optimized one. 
The name of each class follows this pattern: {letter}_{exercise number "_" separated}_{pascal case exercise name}.

Feel free to submit a PR if you spot something wrong (I would be so thankful!)

Have fun!
