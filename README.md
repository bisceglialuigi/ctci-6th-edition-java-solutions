# Cracking the Code interview 6th Edition Java Solutions
In this repo I track my solutions implemented in Java programming language to exercices proposed in the book Cracking The Coding Interview 6th Edition by Gayle Laakmaan Mcdowell.

For each chapter I create a package containing all the exerice solutions. For each exercise I create a class. In the main function of the class I call a method solution where I implement an optimized (as such as I can do) solution to the problem. For each problem I sometimes propose different solutions, each in a "solution" method, followed by a sequence number in the name. 

The name of each class follows this pattern: 
**{letter}_{exercise number with _ as separator}_{pascal case exercise name}**.

**Ex:** *F_1_7_RotateMatrix.java*

Feel free to submit a PR if you spot something wrong (I would be so thankful!) or you have any proposal.

Have fun!
